        Letâ€™s come back to your galaxy spectrum. Notice your spectrum has some bright spikes or faint dips.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bright spikes are <strong>emission lines</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The faint dips are <strong>absorption lines</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the lines in your spectrum is labeled with an element symbol. Click the label to note the element line and its <strong>rest wavelength</strong> in your table.
